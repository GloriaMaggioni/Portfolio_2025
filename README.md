#Personal Portfolio – 2025 Edition

A modern redesign of my personal developer portfolio, rebuilt to improve clarity, performance, accessibility, and user experience.

## Overview

This project is the updated version of my earlier portfolio (2022).
The previous version served its purpose as an initial introduction to my work, but the structure and UI were limited, making it difficult to expand and maintain.

***The new 2025 version introduces:***

- A cleaner interface

- A modular structure for future expansion

- Faster navigation

- Better responsiveness

- Consistent design system using TailwindCSS

- Better separation between content and layout

## Before vs After
